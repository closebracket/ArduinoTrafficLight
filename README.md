# Arduino Traffic Light

This project was written for the <a href="https://www.c4di.co.uk">C4Di</a> Hardware Meetup where I'm learning electronics.

The idea is to create a traffic light system on a breadboard which is connected to the arduino controlled via button on a central breadboard.

The code is specific to the setup I'm using.

Photos to follow.
